# Picticious-Pro
Responsive site for a mobile app

Responsive Site created by Ben Plum.  This was the final website we
designed and developed from site specs, jpegs of the finished project
and a lot of help from Ben himself!
Site works on Gridlock, Bower, Grunt, Normalize, Gridlock and Iâ€™m sure
a few more things that have left my mind!

You can visit live demo of the site here:
